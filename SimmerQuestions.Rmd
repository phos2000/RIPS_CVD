```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

As there are loops, the event name might occur several time. Should we define the

```{r miscarriage}
results %>% filter(resource == "miscarriage")


results %>% filter(strategy == 5 & name == "patient2")
```

the activity_time works as the length of a period, how could the person go through all the kinds of treatments?

```{r}
results %>% filter(resource == "time_in_model")
```

```{r}
results[order(results$name,results$strategy),]
```
